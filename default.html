\Large{Species distribution is the result of complex interactions that involve environmental parameters as well as biotic factors. However, methodological approaches that consider the use of biotic variables during the prediction process are still largely lacking.  Most fishing forecasts use weather data coupled with assumptions about how likely a fish is to appear under given conditions. Fishing success is defined as the expected weight of the fish caught. Previous reports have mainly focused on commercial fishing or limited the research to examining the impact of a single variable. Machine Learning models are used to predict the weight of the fish. With this overview, this project provide following contribution. Firstly, the Fish weight feature dataset from UCI machine repository is subjected with the data processing and cleansing. Secondly, the raw data set is applied to find the regression relationship between all the features with fish weight is done with visualization. Thirdly, the raw dataset and the feature scaled dataset is applied to all the Linear Regression models and the performance is analyzed. Fourth, the raw dataset and the feature scaled dataset is applied to all the Ensembling Regression models and the performance is analyzed through intercept, MAE, MSE, R2Score, and EVS. The python code edited in spyder under Anaconda Navigator is used for implementation }\\

\section{Introduction\\To predict the fish weight we are using machine learning technique.

Supervised machine learning: The process of training algorithms that predict one attribute of a data point, the label, using the other attributes of the data point. The algorithm is trained using a data set, a relation, of pre-labelled data points.

Attributes are commonly divided into multiple input attributes and one output attribute called the label. In this report, input attributes are denoted by X1, X2, ..., Xn and the output attribute, the label, is denoted by Y . Concrete instances of the attributes, data points, are denoted x1, ..., xn, y,length,breadth.

By using the linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression} 
\linespread{1.5} 
\section{Aim of the Seminar\\By using machine learning we are going to to pridiction of fish based on its species features} 
\section{Scope of the Seminar\\The fishing industry includes any industry or activity concerned with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing or selling fish or fish products.
Most of the process in fishing industry need tradition techniques which require more time.
We can’t minimize all the processes but some processes we can.
With the help of old data we can predict the weight of the fish which reduces maximum effort of labour and equipment's required} 
\section{Methodology\\The methodological framework here proposed provided higher predictive accuracy than conventional ANN models on the basis of the selection of correlated species as co-predictors. The most relevant co-predictor species were chosen on the basis of significant improvements in weight value.
This methodology has a capability of finding the weight by taking the necessary inputs. 
The length-weight relationship was established through the equation W = 0.0031×L3.6971 (R² = 0.9796). All linear regressions resulted highly significant, with the  coefficient of determination
